**What is Type Script**

```
It takes in Variables and assigns types to the variables.

```

**Inference**

```
It is a powerful feature from typescript where typeScript is able to automatically
assign a type to my variable incase i had not assigned it manually

TypeScript is very Powerful since it is able to learn and predict the results of
certain types before hand.
